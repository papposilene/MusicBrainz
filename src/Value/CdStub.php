/**
 * A CD stub
 * A CD stub is an anonymously submitted track list that contains a disc ID, barcode, comment field, and basic metadata
 * like a release title and track names.
 * All CD stubs are segregated from the main database and are editable by anyone (whether they are logged in or not),
 * however, they don't benefit from core MusicBrainz features such as edit history, permanent unique identifiers
 * (MBIDs), relationships, release information (date, country, label, etc.), and much more.
 * CD stubs were implemented as a means for people to easily contribute data to MusicBrainz when they are unable, or
 * unwilling, to create an account and add a release. They also enable us to store "untrusted" metadata like the CD Baby
 * music catalog, and to actively serve all this content without cluttering the main database.
