 * A work
 * In MusicBrainz terminology, a work is a distinct intellectual or artistic creation, which can be expressed in the
 * form of one or more audio recordings. While a work in MusicBrainz is usually musical in nature, it is not necessarily
 * so. For example, a work could be a novel, play, poem or essay, later recorded as an oratory or audiobook.
