/**
 * The International Standard Recording Code (ISRC)
 * The International Standard Recording Code, abbreviated to ISRC, is an identification system for audio and music video
 * recordings. It is standarized by the IFPI in ISO 3901:2001 and used by IFPI members to assign a unique identifier to
 * every distinct sound recording they release. An ISRC identifies a particular sound recording, not the song itself.
 * Therefore, different recordings, edits, remixes and remasters of the same song will each be assigned their own ISRC.
 * However, note that same Recording should carry the same ISRC in all countries/territories. Songs are identified by
 * analogous International Standard Musical Work Code (ISWC) codes.
 * Note that an ISRC now is used instead of an ISAN (International Standard AudioVisual Number) for music and audio
 * recordings, as well as for music videos, as the ISRC is more specific, and can have IPIs attached to it, whereas the
 * ISAN was not designed for use in combination with IPIs.
