 * This describes a situation where one label is reissuing, under its own name, (part of) another label's catalog. This
 * can happen in at least three cases:
 * - A label acquires a lease on another label's catalog, for a period of time, in a specific region of the world.
 * - A label buys the rights to a defunct label's catalog, or buys a label (with its catalog) and dismantles it.
 * - A bootleg label reissues another label's catalog.
