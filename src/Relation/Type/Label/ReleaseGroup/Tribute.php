 * This links a release group to a label, to indicate that it is a tribute album. Tribute albums often have a title in
 * the form "A Tribute to Label" or "A Tribute to Artists from Label", and they consist of covers of songs put out by
 * the label, played by other (sometimes very unknown) artists, to honor the label. Often they are various artist
 * compilations, but a single artist can perform the entire tribute album.
