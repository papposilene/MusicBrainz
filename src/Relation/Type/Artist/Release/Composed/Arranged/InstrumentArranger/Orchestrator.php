 * This indicates the person who orchestrated the recording. Orchestration is a special type of arrangement. It means
 * the adaptation of a composition for an orchestra, done in a way that the musical substance remains essentially
 * unchanged. The orchestrator is also responsible for writing scores for an orchestra, band, choral group, individual
 * instrumentalist(s) or vocalist(s). In practical terms it consists of deciding which instruments should play which
 * notes in a piece of music.
