 * An "edited" relation

 * This describes an engineer responsible for either connecting disparate elements of the audio recording, or otherwise
 * redistributing material recorded in the sessions. This is usually secondary, or additional to the work done by the
 * mix engineer. It can also involve streamlining a longer track to around the 3 minute mark in order to make it
 * suitable for radio play (a "radio edit").
