 * This is used to link a karaoke version of a song to the original song.
 * A karaoke version is a version of the song with the main vocals removed, designed to be used for karaoke. These are
 * generally produced from the original masters by muting the main vocal track or by using post-processing filters to
 * remove the vocals. Karaoke versions can be found labelled in numerous different ways other than "karaoke":
 * instrumental (even if backing vocals are still present), off vocal, backing track, etc.
